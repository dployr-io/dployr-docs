## Service Description

Dployr provides a control plane for managing server deployments, instance orchestration, and traffic routing. Users connect their own server infrastructure to the platform via the dployrd agent.

## Customer Data and Ownership

You retain full ownership of your configurations, deployment data, and applications. Dployr claims no ownership over customer content or infrastructure. Dployr accesses customer data only to provide the service and does not use customer data for other purposes.

## Data Processing

For customers processing personal data of EU residents through services deployed via Dployr, a Data Processing Addendum is available upon request. The DPA establishes Dployr as a data processor acting on customer instructions.

- **You retain ownership** of your application code and configurations
- **Open-source components** of Dployr are licensed under the Apache 2.0 license

## Service Availability

Dployr aims to provide reliable service but does not guarantee specific uptime percentages. Scheduled maintenance will be announced in advance where possible.

**Instance availability depends on user infrastructure and is outside Dployr's control.**

Dployr is not responsible for downtime caused by:

- Third-party services
- User misconfiguration
- Circumstances beyond reasonable control

## Limitation of Liability

**Dployr is provided as-is without warranties of any kind,** express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

### Dployr is not liable for:

- Data loss
- Security breaches on user instances
- Service interruptions
- Loss of profits

**Total liability is limited to fees paid by you in the 12 months preceding the claim.**

These limitations apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so some may not apply to you.

Upon termination, user data will be deleted in accordance with the Privacy Policy. Data export is available prior to termination upon request.

## Modifications to Terms

Dployr reserves the right to modify these terms. Material changes will be communicated via email or dashboard notification at least 30 days before taking effect. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.

If you do not agree to modified terms, you must stop using the platform.

## Governing Law and Disputes

These terms are governed by the laws of your jurisdiction of residence. Disputes will be resolved through good faith negotiation. If negotiation fails, disputes may be resolved through binding arbitration or the courts of your jurisdiction, at your choice.

## Severability

If any provision of these terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.

## Entire Agreement

These terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any applicable DPA, constitute the entire agreement between you and Dployr.
