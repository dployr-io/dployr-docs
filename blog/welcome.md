# Welcome to dployr

We're excited to introduce dployr, a self-hosted deployment platform designed to give you complete control over your infrastructure while maintaining the simplicity of modern PaaS solutions.

## What is dployr?

dployr is a self-hosted platform with a globally distributed control plane ("base") and lightweight agents that run on your infrastructure. It combines the best of both worlds:

- **Self-hosted control**: Run dployr on your own infrastructure with full control over your deployments, data, and configurations
- **Globally distributed**: Control plane with mTLS-secured agents running on your instances, connecting from anywhere
- **Multi-runtime support**: Deploy Node.js, Python, Go, PHP, Ruby, .NET, Java, Docker containers, and static sites

## Key Features

### Simple Management
Manage deployments through an intuitive web dashboard or powerful RBAC-aware CLI. No complex configurations or steep learning curves.

### Automatic HTTPS
Built-in Caddy integration for automatic SSL/TLS certificate management. Deploy with confidence knowing your applications are secure by default.

### Open Source
Apache 2.0 licensed with full transparency and community-driven development. Contribute, customize, and extend as needed.
